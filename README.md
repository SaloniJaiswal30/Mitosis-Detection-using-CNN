# Mitosis-Detection-using-CNN
Itâ€™s an image classification project in which automated detection for cancer diagnose. A deep learning based feature extraction method is used and for classification a machine learning method is used. 
### Technologies Used
- Python
- Deep Learning
### Methodology
- Median smoothening to filter noise.
- Kmeans clustering algorithm to reveal cellular structure.
- Blob analysisto eliminate the unnecessary parts and cropping cellular images.
- Feature extraction using CNN.
- Feature selection using PCA and LDA.
- Prediction using SVM.
### Installation
- The data set used in experiments is released by MITOSATYPIA-14 contest in International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) conference.Placed sample data here. 
- pretest.py for making train dataset and pre.py is for test dataset.
- cnn2.py for CNN, PCA, LDA, SVM
